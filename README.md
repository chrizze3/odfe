Open Distro for Elasticsearch visualizations and dashboards.

DARPA 1999 Intrusion Detection Dataset was used to populate the visualizations in the screenshots. 

Note that the Snort 3 Logstash configurations and visualizations are based on the following:

Note that the -y flag has to be enabled in Snort 2 and Snort 3, otherwise Logstash will fail to parse timestamps. It includes year in alert timestamps.
